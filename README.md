# CONTRACT ADVISOR RAG: TOWARDS BUILDING A HIGH-PRECISION LEGAL EXPERT LLM APP

## ContractAdvisorRAG is an AI-powered legal assistance system designed to empower users with quick and accurate answers to their questions about contracts. This project harnesses the power of Langchain to build a sophisticated Question & Answer system with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
# Objectives:

    Develop a robust and scalable Q&A pipeline using Langchain.
    Optimize the retrieval component of the system to improve accuracy and efficiency.
    Evaluate the system's performance using RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Suite).
    Document best practices and challenges encountered during the development process.
